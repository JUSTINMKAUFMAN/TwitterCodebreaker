A Swift codebreaking challenge on Twitter

## Summary

Every week, a Tweet that starts with "CODEBREAKING CHALLENGE X:" will appear on my timeline ([@JUSTINMKAUFMAN](https://twitter.com/JUSTINMKAUFMAN)).
A mysterious robot has been instructed to watch this Tweet carefully and encrypt all replies with a secret function.
Your job is to reverse engineer the secret function driving the robot.
First person to DM me the correct code for the secret function (in Swift) will be announced as the winner!

## Instructions

1. Reply to the Tweet, and within a few seconds the robot will reply back with the encrypted version of your Tweet.
2. Send as many replies as you'd like in order to unravel the mystery.
3. When you think you know the code that the robot is using, DM it to: [@JUSTINMKAUFMAN](https://twitter.com/JUSTINMKAUFMAN).

## Additional Details

1. The `encrypt` function is just one line of code. 
2. It only depends on `Foundation` (if it depends on any framework at all).
3. It runs completely locally (i.e. it does not require any network resources to encrypt strings).
4. The screenshot at the top of this README is the actual (redated) image of the method used for week 1.
